### Logic & Flow (Consistent across 2021–2024)

1. **Schedule C**: Net Profit (Line 31) flows to both **Schedule 1** and **Schedule SE**.
2. **Schedule SE**:
* **Self-Employment Tax**: Calculates Social Security (12.4%) and Medicare (2.9%) on 92.35% of net profit.
* **Deduction**: You get a deduction for 50% of this tax.


3. **Schedule 1**:
* **Part I (Line 3)**: Business income from Schedule C is added to total income.
* **Part II (Line 15)**: The 50% SE tax deduction is subtracted from total income (Adjustments).



### Rule Verification & Annual Thresholds

The $400 filing threshold for SE tax remains constant, but the social security wage base changes annually.

| **SE Tax Rate** | 15.3% | 15.3% | 15.3% | 15.3% |
| **Sch 1 Line for C** | Line 3 | Line 3 | Line 3 | Line 3 |
